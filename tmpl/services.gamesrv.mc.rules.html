<h3>These are the rules for the Minecraft server(s). Generally, it just boils down to common sense:</h3><br>

<ul>
	<li>Don't cheat/hack/whatever to make the experience unfun for other players. This should really just be common sense.</li>
	<li>Try not to overload the server, either by accident or <strong><em>especially</em></strong> on purpose.</li>
	<li>ABSOLUTELY no bigotry whatsoever, no matter what. Just don't be a dick.</li>
	<li>No horniness/NSFW/NSFL/whatever content. There are minors here, including myself. Keep it in your pants.</li>
	<li>Don't drag your drama/malarkey here. We don't give a rat's fat ass about RandomPersonMcGee pissing in your cheerios. Keep it to y'all's DMs.</li>
	<li>Stick to the channel's topic.</li>
	<li>Don't be a backseat mod. You have no power here, mere mortal.</li>
	<li>If the community or a staff member tells you to knock it off, just do it. Don't cause any unnessecary bullshit.</li>
	<li>Keep heavy bot usage in the bot channel.</li>
	<li>When in doubt, just use common sense. Don't spam, don't be a dick, don't spread lies, et al.</li>
	<li>...</li>
	<li>Profit!</li>
</ul>


<h4><em><u>In layman's terms, don't be a ding-dong.</u></em></h4>
