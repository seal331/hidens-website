<h3>These are the rules for the Discord server. Generally, it just boils down to common sense:</h3><br>

<ul>
	<li>Obviously, follow the <a href=http://dis.gd/terms>Discord TOS</a>. If you're under 13 years old, you will be banned until your 13th birthday. Do not dumb.</li>
	<li>ABSOLUTELY no bigotry whatsoever, no matter what. Just don't be a dick.</li>
	<li>No horniness/NSFW/NSFL/whatever content. There are minors here, including myself. Keep it in your pants.</li>
	<li>Don't drag your drama/malarkey here. We don't give a rat's fat ass about RandomPersonMcGee pissing in your cheerios. Keep it to y'all's DMs.</li>
	<li>Stick to the channel's topic.</li>
	<li>Don't be a backseat mod. You have no power here, mere mortal.</li>
	<li>If the community or a staff member tells you to knock it off, just do it. Don't cause any unnessecary bullshit.</li>
	<li>Keep heavy bot usage in the bot channel.</li>
	<li>When in doubt, just use common sense. Don't spam, don't be a dick, don't spread lies, et al.</li>
	<li>...</li>
	<li>Profit!</li>
</ul>
