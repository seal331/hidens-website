<h3>These are the rules for the Discord server. Generally, it just boils down to common sense:</h3><br>

<ul>
	<li>Obviously, follow the <a href=http://dis.gd/terms>Discord TOS</a>. If you're under 13 years old, you will be banned until your 13th birthday.</li>
	<li>No bigotry whatsoever, no matter what. This includes racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc.</li>
	<li>No NSFW/NSFL content. Risque memes are fine, downright porn isn't.</li>
	<li>This server isn't your personal playground, don't bring your own drama and bullshit here.</li>
	<li>Try to stay civil when discussing something potentially controversial like politics. If you can't discuss things like that without getting heated, just don't discuss it at all.</li>
	<li>Try to stick to the channels' intended topic.</li>
	<li>Please don't backseat moderate. Leave moderation up to actual staff, as you're a mere peasant (/s).</li>
	<li>Ad-hoc rules can and will be made if you're annoying/an asshole. If a staff member/the general community tells you to knock it off/shut the fuck up and you don't, don't expect things to look pretty.</li>
	<li>...</li>
	<li>Profit!</li>
</ul>

<h4><em><u>In layman's terms, don't be a ding-dong.</u></em></h4>
