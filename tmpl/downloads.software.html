			<p>Frontpage</p>
		</td>
		<td>
			<p>Frontpage was a program by Microsoft that made building websites very easy, with some features from other applications in the Microsoft Office suite. It's not as useful in the current day considering it utlizied IE's own HTML extensions that have obviously been phased out by the late 2000s, but it's still fun. It also repersents my favorite era of the internet (90s - early to mid 00s), so there's that.</p>

			<p>Netscape</p>
		</td>
		<td>
			<p>Netscape is a discontinued internet suite, and was the main competitor to Internet Explorer in the 1990s and early 2000s. It's market share dropped sharply in the late 1990s due to IE gaining traction, because it was bundled with Windows and, at the time, Mac OS (which eventually led to the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.>antitrust lawsuit Microsoft received by the USA government in 2001</a>). It was eventually superseded by Mozilla Firefox (which was a lot more successful against IE). The version available is 7.2.</p>
