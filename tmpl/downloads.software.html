            <p>Frontpage was a program by Microsoft that made building webistes very easy, with some features from other applications in the Microsoft Office suite.

            <p>Virtual PC was a hypervisor originally developed by Connectix, but later sold to Microsoft. It was (sort-of) replaced by Hyper-V. Get version <a href=/storage/software/vpc/2007/setup.exe>2007</a>.</p>
            <p>If you want to run it on Windows 8 or higher, change the setup file's name to something else, do the same thing for the program's executable. If you're running the x86 version of Windows 8 - 10, you don't need to do anything else. However, if you use x64 8/8.1, you also need to replace VMM.sys in your <code>C:\Windows\System32\drivers</code> folder with <a href=/storage/software/vpc/2007/vmm.zip>this updated version</a>. <u>This does not work on the x64 version of Windows 10, only the x86 version. It does not work on Windows 11.</u></p>
            <p>If you want the rollup that adds some extra goodies, such as fullscreen 1080p and fixes to networking, get that <a href=/storage/software/vpc/2007/vpc2007sp1_rollup.zip>here</a>. Replace the files in your installation directory with these.</p>
